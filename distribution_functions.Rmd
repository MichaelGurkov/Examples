# Distribution functions

# Distribution function

The distribution function is used to understand are we near bottom
(lower/smaller quantiles) or the top (higher/larger quantiles) of the
distribution. For example the standard normal distribution can "draw" any value
but "most" of them will be between -3 and 3. So if we ask where -2 lies we
should get the answer that it is near the start/bottom of the distribution so we would expect low quantile. The distribution function in R starts with the prefix
"p" followed by the distribution family. For example the distribution fucntion
of the standard normal distribution is *pnorm*


```{r distribution_function}

pnorm(-2)

```


# Density function

The density function is used to estimate the probability of "drawing" a
specified value from the distribution. For example the standard normal distribution is centered at zero so 0 is the most probable value.

```{r density_function}

dnorm(0)

```
